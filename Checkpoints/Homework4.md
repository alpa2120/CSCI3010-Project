# Homework 4 - Project Check In

## 1)
### Planned Progress for April 10th:

- Each topic/section will have the "Learn" tab completed. This will mean for the four sections (currently) we provide, the learn tab will have a carousel/slide-show functionality that contains all relevant content to the topic. We think that if we had completed one of these learn tabs for the March 22nd deadline, we would have been in good shape ('navigating the topic' completed). So for April 10th, we will have this completed for all four sections.
- For the March 29th deadline, we wanted to have at least one activity completed for a section, applying the general layout of this activity to each topic that we added. By April 10th, then, we will have completed the two activities for each topic/section. Currently, we are planning on having activity 1 being a quiz that covers the material of the topic, and activity 2 will be an interactive matching game that also covers the material of the topic. We will apply this general template of a quiz + matching game to each of the topics/sections by April 10th.
- On top of the additions to the application's functionality, we will also provide a list of things that can be added/removed/improved to and from the website. This list may include simple issues like a UI bug, to more elaborate ideas like including another supplemental activity to a given topic. This will allow us, going forward from the HW4 deadline, to have a list of things that we can complete and turn in for the HW5 deadline.

### Actual progress for April 10th:
For this deadline, we completed the "learn" tabs which contain information about each of the subjects. The quiz activity is still a work in progress, but the main logic is complete, and a section for a video link has been added. The useful links have not been selected yet and still need to be updated, but the logic is there.
a) Initially we had planned on having a matching activity, but we found that implementing a video would be more impactful to the user and help with their learning more effectively. Considering that we already have an interactive activity implemented, we thought that a page with useful links and videos would be more influential.

### What you had planned to do for the next deadline: 
For the next deadline we plan to mainly make improvements
- Improve the quizzes to give a report when the user submits the quiz - so the user knows how well they have mastered the material
- Update the useful links to be unique for each page - providing resources relevant to each topic will help the user learn
- Possibly add another page for the useful links rather than just having a card - if we have enough links, a new page will be needed
- Format the text on the learn tab - one giant wall of text isn't very effective, bullet points and sections will be useful
- Possibly update the styling to be more appealing (This will only be done if everything else is completed)
