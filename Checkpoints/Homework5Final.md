# Homework 5 - Project Turn In

## 1)
### Planned Progress for May 3rd:

- Improve the quizzes to give a report when the user submits the quiz - so the user knows how well they have mastered the material
- Update the useful links to be unique for each page - providing resources relevant to each topic will help the user learn
- Possibly add another page for the useful links rather than just having a card - if we have enough links, a new page will be needed
- Format the text on the learn tab - one giant wall of text isn't very effective, bullet points and sections will be useful
- Possibly update the styling to be more appealing (This will only be done if everything else is completed)


## 2) 
### Actual progress for May 3rd:
- We improved the quiz tab so that it gives a report when the user submits their answers (questions turn green/red depending on the answer)
- We updated the links under the resource tab for each section. While it's not the prettiest tab, each resource tab has unique external sources for information covering the topic at hand
- The resource tab we updated is now its own page (previously was just a card) - the user can click on the tab and will be presented with a list of external resources
- The text on the learn tabs has been formatted - each slide on the carousel has text split up into bullet points
- We haven't made any updates to the styling of the application - we managed to get everything else done except this (this would be as easy as copy and pasting some css)
