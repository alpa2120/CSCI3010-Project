# Homework 3 - Project Check In


## 1)
### Planned progress for March 13th:
For the turn in on this date, we will be uploading the front end code that is used to generate the general section template.
  
## 2) 
### Actual progress for March 13th:
We have the general section template that we can use for the various topics we are going to include in the application.

The current home page:

The current section template:

There are no major differences/discrepancies between what we said we would have and what we do have. The only improvement/fix we could make for the template is a color scheme change (it's kinda ugly..)

## 3)
### What you had planned to do for the next deadline:
For the turn in on this date, we will have pushed the current version of the
application to our repo (which you have access to) along with a document highlighting
things we would like to change in the application.

It's tough to tell narrow down how close we can follow our planned schedule at this point, but we are very confident that we can turn in what we intended to at the start of the project. As of writing this checkpoint, some major areas of focus for us will be implementing the activities for each section along with starting to add in actual material on the topics.
