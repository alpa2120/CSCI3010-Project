# CSCI 3010 Project

This project was developed by Alex Palo and Sam Goulding for CSCI 3010 - Programming Project Workshop.

The goal of this project is to create an application that helps users familiarize themselves with the world of Cybersecurity.

All code that we write can be seen at `Code/src/app`. Everything else is likely autogenerated by Angular.

> We have developed all code in Visual Studio Code with a Powershell terminal. We are unsure of any issues that may arrise when attempting to run on a Unix machine. If you are unable to run the code on a local machine, refer to the Github Pages link above. That link will direct you to the home page of our most recent build, which is exactly what you would see when viewing the page on a local host.

### Directions to run locally:

1. Ensure that you have the Angular CLI installed for VS Code.
2. Navigate to the `Code` directory of this project in your terminal. (We use powershell)
### Installs needed to run (if modules haven't already been):
>>npm install bootstrap@4.0.0
>>npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@1
3. Run 'npm rebuild node-sass' to include newly installed modules
4. Run `ng serve` in your terminal.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in a browser. (We use Chrome)
6. The application should now be running locally and viewable at the local host link mentioned above.

## Project Dependencies

To use Angular CLI, follow these instructions provided by Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/angular-tutorial

Note: You will need to install the Node.js Javascript runtime and the npm package.

### Installs needed to run:

>>npm install bootstrap@4.0.0

>>npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@1

## General Angular Information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
